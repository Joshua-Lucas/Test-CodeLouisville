        <h1>The structure of the document</h1>
        <p> You should use the header, main, and footer elements to break up your page. </p>

        <h2>The Header Element</h2>
        <p>The header specifies the header of the document or section of the page. You are able to have multiple headers in the document, but you cannot nest it in a footer,address or another header element. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Navigation</li>
            <li>Logo or icon</li>
            <li>one or more heading elements</li>
            <li>authorship info</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Main Element</h2>
        <p>The main element specifies the main content of the document.</p>

        <h2>The Footer Element</h2>
        <p>The footer defines the footer for the document or section. This means you can have multiple footers in one document.</p>

        <h3>Common element in a footer</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>copy right info</li>
          <li>contact info</li>
